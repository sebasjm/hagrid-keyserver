    <h3 id="no-sign-verified"><a href="#no-sign-verified">Why not sign keys
            after verification?</a></h3>

    The <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span> service is meant for key
    distribution and discovery, not as a de-facto CA.  Client implementations
    that want to offer verified communication should rely on their own trust
    model.

    <h3 id="non-email-uids"><a href="#non-email-uids">Why is there no support
            for identities that aren't e-mail addresses?</a></h3>

    <p>
        We require explicit consent to distribute identity information.
        Identities that aren't e-mail addresses, such as pictures or addresses,
        offer no simple way for us to acquire this consent.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note: Some OpenPGP software creates keys with incorrectly formatted
        e-mail addresses.  These addresses might not be recognized correctly on
        <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span>.

    <h3 id="third-party-signatures"><a href="#third-party-signatures">
            Do you distribute "third party signatures"?</a></h3>

    <p>
        Short answer: No.
    </p>

    <p>
        A "third party signature" is a signature on a key
        that was made by some other key.
        Most commonly,
        those are the signatures produced when "signing someone's key",
        which are the basis for
        the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust" target="_blank">Web of Trust</a>".
        For a number of reasons,
        those signatures are not currently distributed
        via <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The killer reason is <strong>spam</strong>.
        Third party signatures allow attaching arbitrary data to anyone's key,
        and nothing stops a malicious user from
        attaching so many megabytes of bloat to a key
        that it becomes practically unusable.
        Even worse,
        they could attach offensive or illegal content.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are ideas to resolve this issue.
        For example, signatures could be distributed with the signer,
        rather than the signee.
        Alternatively, we could require
        cross-signing by the signee before distribution
        to support a
        <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/caff" target="_blank">caff-style</a>
        workflow.
        If there is enough interest,
        we are open to working with other OpenPGP projects
        on a solution.
    </p>

    <h3 id="revoked-uids"><a href="#revoked-uids">Why are revoked identities not
            distributed as such?</a></h3>

    <p>
        When an OpenPGP key marks one of its identities as revoked, this
        identity should no longer be considered valid for the key.  And this
        information should ideally be distributed to all OpenPGP clients that
        already know about the newly revoked identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, there is currently no good way to distribute revocations,
        that doesn't also reveal the revoked identity itself.  We don't want to
        distribute revoked identities, so we can't distribute the identity at
        all.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are proposed solutions to this issue, that allow the distribution
        of revocations without also revealing the identity itself.  But so far
        there is no final specification, or support in any OpenPGP software.  We
        hope that a solution will be established in the near future, and will
        add support on <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span> as soon as
        we can.

        Of course!

        you can reach <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span> anonymously

    <h3 id="encrypt-verification-emails"><a href="#encrypt-verification-emails">
            Why not encrypt verification e-mails?</a></h3>

    Various reasons:
    <ol>
        <li>It is more complicated, both for our users and for us.</li>
        <li>It doesn't prevent attacks - an attacker gains nothing from
            uploading a key they don't have access to.</li>
        <li>Deletion would still have to be possible even when a key is
            lost.</li>
        <li>It would require a different (and more complicated) mechanism to
            upload keys that can only sign.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="sks-pool"><a href="#sks-pool">Is this server part of the "SKS" pool?</a>
    </h3>

    <p>No. The "append-only" federation model of the SKS pool leads to various
        problems, that make both operation and use of those servers very
        difficult.  There is also no simple way to store information about
        e-mail verification in a federated way.
    </p>
    <p>We do plan to explore options for a distributed service in the future, so
        users can choose between different service operators again.

    <h3 id="older-gnupg"><a href="#older-gnupg">
	I have trouble updating some keys with GnuPG.  Is there a bug?
    </a></h3>

    <p>
      This is a problem with current versions of GnuPG.  If you attempt to
      update a key from <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span> that
      contains no <a href="/about">identity information</a>, GnuPG will refuse
      to process the key:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      $ gpg --receive-keys A2604867523C7ED8<br />
      gpg: key A2604867523C7ED8: no user ID
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      We are working with the GnuPG team to resolve this problem.
